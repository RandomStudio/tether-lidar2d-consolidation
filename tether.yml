  title: Tether Lidar2D Consolidation Agent
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |
    An Agent that converts raw scan data (angles and distance measurements) and converts these to a "map" of 2D points, rather like a "point cloud" but on a flat 2D plane. It then applies a clustering algorithm to these points to produce a much smaller number of "tracking points" which are made available to other agents.
